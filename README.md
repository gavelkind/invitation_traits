This mod for Crusader Kings II allows players to search for characters who will accept an [invitation to court](http://www.ckiiwiki.com/Diplomatic_actions#Invite_to_court). With the mod installed, type "accept_invite" in the character search box.

It is incomplete, especially around bribes. It should work correctly when the factors involved are:

* Opinion
* A single claim (outside your realm)

It will break save compatibility between major versions of the game, or when installing other mods that also add traits.

![img](https://www.squarefree.com/crusaderkings/icons/Ironman_enabled_restrictions_24.png) This mod disables ironman achievements. It only gives you faster access to information you already have, but it does so by adding decisions and events, so the game engine considers it a possible cheat.
